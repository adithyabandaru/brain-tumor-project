# brain-tumor-project
Brain tumor detection using deep learning applied to MRI scans. This project employs CNNs for binary and multi-class classification, with and without transfer learning (VGG16, ResNet50, Inception v3). It automates tumor detection with high sensitivity and specificity, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing patient care.
